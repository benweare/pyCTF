# pyCTF

pyCTF allows manipulation of experimental contrast transfer functions (CTFs), primarily to measure lens aberrations in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). See the Jupyter Notebook for worked examples.

The following objective lens aberrations can be measured:
- Defocus
- Spherical aberration
- Chromatic aberration

Other functionality:
- Remove background noise
- Simulating CTFs (1D and 2D)

We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvements!

## Installation

pyCTF can be installed with pip.
